# commuter

Curious to work out my commuting patterns. Gonna use my Opal data to find out spikes in commute times. Mainly focussed on the morning commute.

## Running

Tested on macOS 10.14, with Node 10 and yarn.

Create an environment file, `dev.env` and add your respective `OPAL_USERNAME` and `OPAL_PASSWORD` variables.

Then run:

```
yarn && yarn start
```
